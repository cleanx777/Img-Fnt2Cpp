## 🧠 Overview

**XitersEngine2Cpp** is a web-based utility that allows developers to convert image and font files into usable C++ `unsigned char[]` arrays. This is particularly helpful for embedding assets (like splash screens, logos, or custom fonts) directly into C++ applications without external file dependencies.

Built with 💖 using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
